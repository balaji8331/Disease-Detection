🩺 Health Vision – AI-Powered Medical Diagnosis
📚 Project Overview
Health Vision is an AI-powered web application developed using Streamlit that analyzes medical images and predicts possible diseases. It covers a wide range of medical conditions such as brain tumors, pneumonia, bone fractures, skin infections, kidney stones, and eye infections. The application processes uploaded images and uses pre-trained CNN models to classify them and suggest appropriate precautions.

🎯 Key Features
✅ Disease Detection:
Detects diseases from various medical categories such as brain, chest, bones, skin, kidneys, and eyes.
Provides classification results with high accuracy using deep learning models.

✅ Precautionary Advice:
Suggests necessary precautions based on the detected condition.
Helps users understand the severity and possible next steps.

✅ User-Friendly Interface:
Simple and intuitive interface built with Streamlit.
Supports image uploads and real-time predictions.

⚙️ Technology Stack
Frontend: Streamlit
Backend: Python (TensorFlow, OpenCV, NumPy)
Machine Learning Models: CNN models trained for different medical conditions

🧠 Model Details
The application utilizes several pre-trained CNN models for different categories:
All-in-One Model: Determines the category of the uploaded image.
Bone Model: Detects fractures and provides suggestions.
Brain Model: Identifies tumors such as glioma, meningioma, pituitary, or no tumor.
Chest Model: Detects pneumonia or normal condition.
Eye Model: Recognizes glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, cataract, and normal conditions.
Kidney Model: Detects cysts, tumors, stones, or normal conditions.
Skin Model: Identifies various skin conditions such as melanoma, keratosis, and carcinoma.
